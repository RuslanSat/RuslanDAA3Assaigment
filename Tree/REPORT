| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Total Cost | 16                   | 16                   |
| MST Edges  | 4 (V−1)              | 4 (V−1)              |
| Operations | ~40–45               | ~35–40               |
| Time (ms)  | ~0.1–0.2             | ~0.1–0.15            |
| MST        | (B–C, A–C, B–D, D–E) | (B–C, A–C, B–D, D–E) |

### Test Case 2: 4 Vertices, 5 Edges

**Input:**

* Vertices: A, B, C, D
* Edges: 5
* Density: 0.63 (sparse)

| Metric     | Prim’s          | Kruskal’s       |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Total Cost | 6               | 6               |
| MST Edges  | 3 (V−1)         | 3 (V−1)         |
| Operations | ~25–30          | ~28–35          |
| Time (ms)  | ~0.05–0.1       | ~0.08–0.12      |
| MST        | (A–B, B–C, C–D) | (A–B, B–C, C–D) |

**Observations:**

1. Both algorithms yield the same MST cost and number of edges.
2. Results vary slightly in execution time and operation count.
3. MST edge sets may differ, but total cost remains identical.

## 2. Efficiency and Performance Comparison

### 2.1 Time Complexity

**Prim’s Algorithm:**

* With adjacency matrix: O(V²)
* With priority queue and adjacency list: O(E log V)
* Implementation used: O(E log V)

**Kruskal’s Algorithm:**

* Sorting edges: O(E log E) ≈ O(E log V)
* Using Union-Find for cycle detection
* Implementation used: O(E log E)

**Comparison:**

* Sparse graphs: Kruskal’s may be faster (fewer edges).
* Dense graphs: Prim’s often performs better.
* Both have near-identical asymptotic complexity.

### 2.2 Space Complexity

Both algorithms use **O(V + E)** space.

* Prim’s: adjacency list + priority queue
* Kruskal’s: sorted edge list + Union-Find arrays

### 2.3 Practical Performance

* **Sparse graphs:** Minimal sorting overhead; Kruskal’s often slightly faster.
* **Dense graphs:** Prim’s handles numerous edges more efficiently.
* **Overall:** Results are implementation-dependent but comparable.

### 2.4 Operation Breakdown

**Prim’s:**

* Adjacency building: O(E)
* Queue insert/extract: O(E log V)
* Visited checks: O(V)
* **Total:** O(E log V)

**Kruskal’s:**

* Sort edges: O(E log E)
* Union-Find: O(E α(V))
* **Total:** O(E log E)

## 3. Trade-offs and Use Cases

### When to Use Prim’s Algorithm

**Advantages:**

* Ideal for **dense** graphs
* Efficient memory use
* Incremental edge addition possible
* Deterministic starting point

**Best suited for:**

* Dense networks (urban areas, data centers)
* Real-time or dynamic graphs
* Adjacency-list representations

**Disadvantages:**

* Slightly more complex due to queue operations
* Less efficient on very sparse graphs

### When to Use Kruskal’s Algorithm

**Advantages:**

* Excellent for **sparse** graphs
* Simple, edge-centric design
* Predictable and stable performance
* Easy to parallelize

**Best suited for:**

* Transportation and road networks
* Clustering problems
* Pre-sorted or batch edge data

**Disadvantages:**

* Requires complete edge list
* Sorting overhead on dense graphs

### Graph Density Effect

| Graph Type     | Recommended Algorithm | Reason                   |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Sparse (E ≈ V) | Kruskal’s             | Sorting cost minimal     |
| Medium Density | Either                | Comparable efficiency    |
| Dense (E ≈ V²) | Prim’s                | Avoids full-edge sorting |

## 4. Implementation and Maintainability

**Prim’s Algorithm:**

* ~80 lines of code
* Priority queue and adjacency list logic
* Common pitfalls: duplicate edges, queue mismanagement

**Kruskal’s Algorithm:**

* ~120 lines (includes Union-Find)
* Conceptually simpler but needs reliable cycle detection
* Common pitfalls: incorrect parent/rank handling

**Maintainability:**

* Prim’s: moderate complexity, good for dynamic graphs
* Kruskal’s: clear structure, good for static graphs

**Verification Checks:**
✅ Identical MST cost
✅ Exactly V−1 edges
✅ No cycles
✅ All vertices connected

## 5. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. Both algorithms produce correct and identical MSTs.
2. Performance varies with graph structure.
3. Neither algorithm is universally superior.
4. Both scale efficiently with proper data structures.

### For City Transportation Networks

**Use Kruskal’s if:**

* Network is sparse (typical for road systems)
* All edges are known in advance
* Simple, verifiable implementation preferred

**Use Prim’s if:**

* Network is dense or frequently updated
* Graph stored as adjacency list
* Incremental MST updates required

**Recommendation:**
In most real transportation networks (sparse by nature), **Kruskal’s algorithm** is the more practical choice — it’s easier to maintain, debug, and explain to non-technical stakeholders.
